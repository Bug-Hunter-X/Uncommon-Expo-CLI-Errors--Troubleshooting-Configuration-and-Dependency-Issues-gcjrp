The solution typically involves carefully reviewing the `app.json` and `app.config.js` files for any discrepancies or missing information.  Ensure all dependencies listed in `package.json` are compatible with the current Expo SDK version. Correcting version mismatches, updating dependencies using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`, and restarting the Expo CLI process often resolves the issue.  Additionally, verifying the correct Node.js and npm/yarn versions, and checking for any permissions-related problems, can prevent these errors.  Specific solutions might involve using the Expo CLI commands such as `expo prebuild` to detect configuration problems before attempting a build.
