This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI in conjunction with a project that has incorrect or missing configuration settings, especially concerning the `app.json` or `app.config.js` file.  A common cause is an issue with the project's versioning or dependencies, leading to conflicts during the build or start process. Another frequent cause stems from problems with the environment setup, such as incorrect Node.js version, missing dependencies, or permissions issues.
